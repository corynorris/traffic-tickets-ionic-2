## Overview
An `Ionic 2` project with `AngularJS 2 (Beta)` that demonstrates user interaction, google maps, and advanced map features such as heatmaps.

## Contents
`app/` - The `AngularJS` code that allows the application to run. In `AngularJS 2` the html, css and js code are grouped in subdirectories within this folder.

## Limitations
This project was intended to contrast some differences between `Angular 1` and `Angular 2` as well as the differences between `Ionic 1` and `Ionic 2`. As such, the code organization is somewhat lacking.
